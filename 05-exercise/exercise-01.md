# Exercise Instructions

## 1. Lowest, Highest, and Average Value

Write a function to get the lowest, highest, and average value in the array (with and without using the sort function).

**Example:**

```js
const arr = [12, 5, 23, 18, 4, 45, 32];
// Output → { lowest: 4, highest: 45, average: 19.8xxx }
```

## 2. Join Words into a Sentence

Write a function that takes an array of words and returns a string by concatenating the words in the array, separated by commas and - the last word - by an 'and'.

**Example:**

```js
const arr = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"];
// Output → "apple,banana,cherry, and date"
```

## 3. Second Smallest Number

Write a function from a given array of numbers and return the second smallest number.

**Example:**

```js
const numbers = [5, 3, 1, 7, 2, 6];
// Output → 2
```

## 4. Sum of Two Arrays (Same Length)

Write a function to calculate each element in the same position from two arrays of integer. Assume both arrays are of the same length.

**Example:**

```js
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [3, 2, 1];
// Output → [4, 4, 4]
```

## 5. Add Unique Element

Write a function that adds an element to the end of an array. However, the element should only be added if it is not already in the array

(Read: add an element to the end of an array only if it is not already included).

**Example 1:**

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let newElement = 4;
// Output → [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Example 2:**

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let newElement = 7;
// Output → [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
```
